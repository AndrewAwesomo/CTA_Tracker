# CTA_Tracker
simple CTA tracker app for RPI

<b>API key setup:</b>

* After cloning or downloading, rename api_keys_generic.txt to api_keys.txt

* Then replace the 'xxxxxxxxx' with your own CTA API keys.  Be sure to keep the single quotes as this will be
read in as a dictionary.

* If you need api keys go to the following URLs to request one for the Train Tracker and one for the Bus Tracker

1. Train tracker: http://www.transitchicago.com/developers/traintrackerapply.aspx

2. Bus tracker: You will need to create a developer account here: http://www.ctabustracker.com/bustime/login.jsp
Then go to http://www.ctabustracker.com/bustime/updateDeveloper.jsp or click the "My API" button next to "Sign Out"
in the upper right hand corner of your account page.  You can then register for an API key.
